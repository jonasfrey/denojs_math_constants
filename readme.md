# math_constants
this repository just acts as a collection for various math constants,
if you want to have more constants added, open a feature request
i mainly created this repo for my beloved `N_TAU = 6.2831...` constant :D
## usage
```javascript

import {
    N_TAU, 
    N_PI
}
// from "https://deno.land/x/math/mod.js"
from "./mod.js"
console.log(`the assumption that tau is bigger than pi is (N_TAU > N_PI): ${N_TAU > N_PI}`);
```
